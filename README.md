# R code for "Conformal causal inference for cluster randomized trials: model-robust inference without asymptotic approximations"

This repo stores the code for simulation and data analysis in the paper "Conformal causal inference for cluster randomized trials: model-robust inference without asymptotic approximations". 

- __data-analysis-PPACT.R__ contains the code for re-analyzing a cluster randomized trial, the data of which is not publicly available.
- __simulation-cluster.R__, __simulation-indvidiual.R__, __simulation-m30.R__ correspond to the simulation studies for cluster-level treatment effects given 100 clusters, individual-level treatment effects 100 clusters, and results for 30 clusters, respectively.
